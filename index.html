                    My main skills involve: HTML5, CSS3, <span class="red-one">JavaScript</span>, Sass, SaaS, HTTP, API, JSON. <br> <br>
                    
                    Throughout my career I have used various frameworks and libraries, but the one I prefer using is <span class="red-one">React.js</span>. <br> <br>
                    
                    I am also familiar with desktop-app development using <span class="red-one">C#</span> and <span class="red-one">ASP</span>. <br> <br>
                    
                    I am constantly upgrading and learning, therefore my next goal is learning <span class="red-one">React Native</span>, and expanding my <span class="red-one">Node.js</span> knowledge.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-pad basic">- I worked for 6 months as a tech support on the Epic Games project. There I had my first brushes with SQL, JSON files, and many different tools and procedures including skilled use of documentation.
